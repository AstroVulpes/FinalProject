# FinalProject (C#): Riivyu, a movie rating database.
## Lexicon IT-p√•byggnadsutbildning
This is a database for adding reviews to movies implemented in C# / ASP.NET Model-View-Controller. Movies are stored with relevant information and a movie poster to identify them. They are displayed on an index page, and each movie has a details page that displays the data and comments. Comments are stored with the IDs of the user and the associated movie, and are displayed under each movie. Movies and comments have full CRUD support for registered users.
